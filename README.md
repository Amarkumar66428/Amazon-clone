Developing an Amazon clone entails creating a web application that matches the functionality and style of Amazon's e-commerce platform. The following is a simple plan for setting up a Git repository for an Amazon clone:

Project framework: Establish the fundamental framework of your project. Organise your files and directories in a sensible manner. Typical directories include:

src: This directory contains your source code.
The public folder contains static assets like as photos, fonts, and the main HTML page.
styles: Maintains your CSS or preprocessor files.
scripts: This folder contains JavaScript files.
Create the HTML structure for your Amazon clone's primary pages, such as the homepage, product listing page, product details page, and shopping cart. Use semantic HTML to improve accessibility.

CSS style: Use CSS style to mimic the Amazon UI. You may either utilise a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or design your own unique styles. Ensure responsiveness for a unified experience across several devices.

JavaScript Functionality: Use JavaScript to implement client-side functionality. Features could include:

The product listing and information are displayed.
Shopping cart administration.
Optional user authentication.
Search feature is available.
User feedback and ratings.
Development of the backend:
Create a server with your preferred backend technology (Node.js with Express, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.). Implement the API endpoints required for:

Product recovery.
Authentication and authorization of users.
Cart administration.
Order fulfilment.

User Authentication: Enable users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts by implementing user authentication. Maintain safe password storage and session management.

Shopping Cart Functionality: Create the ability to add/remove goods from the cart, update amounts, and proceed to checkout. Consider leveraging technologies such as WebSockets to implement real-time updates.
